## Temperature Performance

| Room           | Target | Tolerance | Test Condition                             |
| -------------- | ------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Electric Sauna | 85°C   | ±5°C      | At bench head height, after 45 min warm-up |
| Infrared Sauna | 55°C   | ±5°C      | Air temp, with panels at full power        |

### Testing Protocol

1. Pre-heat electric sauna for 45 minutes
2. Measure temperature at seated head height
3. Record time to reach operating temperature
4. Document heater cycling behavior
