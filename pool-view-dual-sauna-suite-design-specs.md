# Project: Pool-View Dual Sauna Suite (Hinoki) — Design Specs v1.0

## 0) Summary
Build a **3-room suite** inside a footprint of **W 2.95 m × L 4.62 m × H 3.50 m**, visually connected to an **outdoor swimming pool** via a large window. Includes:
- **Sauna A:** Traditional **electric heater** (higher temp)
- **Sauna B:** **Infrared** (lower temp)
- **Room 3:** **Vestibule / cool-down / entry**

Key requirement: the **two sauna rooms connect via an internal door** (sauna-to-sauna).

---

## 1) Space + layout requirements

### Fixed envelope (given)
- **Internal footprint:** 2.95 m (W) × 4.62 m (L)
- **Ceiling height:** 3.50 m (structural)

### Program (3 rooms)
1) **Vestibule / Cool-down**
2) **Infrared sauna**
3) **Electric sauna**

### Recommended plan (works with pool window + 3 rooms + connected saunas)
- Put the **window on the pool-facing long wall** and allocate that wall to the **vestibule** so you get the view without destroying sauna efficiency.
- Put **both saunas along the length** behind the vestibule, with:
  - a door from vestibule into each sauna
  - a **connecting door between saunas**

#### Room split targets (net internal sizes)
> Final dims depend on partition thickness; these are the intended net clear dims.

- **Vestibule:** **W 1.05 m × L 4.62 m × H 3.50 m**
- **Sauna band:** **W 1.90 m × L 4.62 m**
  - **Infrared Sauna:** **W 1.90 m × L 2.31 m**
  - **Electric Sauna:** **W 1.90 m × L 2.31 m**

---

## 2) Capacity + seating (10 people total)

### Seating strategy
- Both saunas: **L-shaped bench**
- Target combined capacity: **10 people total** (across both saunas)

### Bench spec (each sauna)
- **Bench depth:** 500–550 mm  
- **Seat height:** 450 mm  
- **Backrest:** 15–20° recline  
- **Reality check:** 10 people is doable but “cozy.” For true comfort, treat it as **8 comfy / 10 max**.

**Optional upgrade (recommended):** Add an **upper bench tier** in the electric sauna to improve capacity without crowding.

---

## 3) Temperature + heater systems

### Sauna A — Traditional electric (hotter)
- **Operating temp:** **75–90°C**
- **Heater type:** electric sauna heater with stones
- **Estimated size:** ~9–10 m³ room volume (assuming lowered sauna ceiling; see below)
- **Heater power target:** **8–10 kW** class (final per manufacturer sizing + insulation + glazing)

### Sauna B — Infrared (lower temp)
- **Operating temp:** **45–60°C**
- **Heating:** carbon/ceramic infrared panels
- **Power target:** typically **2–3.5 kW** depending on panel layout and intensity

---

## 4) Ceiling + heat efficiency (important)
Your structural height is **3.5 m**, which is way too tall for a sauna to run efficiently.

### Spec
- **Both saunas must have a dropped interior ceiling at 2.2–2.3 m**
  - reduces warm-up time + power cost
  - creates a service void for wiring/venting
- Vestibule can keep full height for a premium “open” feel.

---

## 5) Doors (incl. sauna-to-sauna connection)

### Doors required
- Vestibule → Infrared sauna door
- Vestibule → Electric sauna door
- **Infrared sauna ↔ Electric sauna connecting door** (mandatory)

### Door spec
- **Swing:** all sauna doors **outward**
- **Clear opening:** minimum 700 mm (800 mm preferred)
- **Construction:** tempered glass (8–10 mm) in wood frame OR insulated sauna-rated wood door with vision panel
- **Hardware:** sauna-rated hinges, magnetic latch, no keyed lock

---

## 6) Pool-view window spec

### Location (recommended)
- In **vestibule**, facing the pool, spanning as much of the long wall as practical.

### Performance
- **Glazing:** insulated tempered (double or triple glazing)
- **Frame:** thermally broken aluminum or treated exterior-grade wood
- **Condensation control:** vestibule needs mild air movement + properly detailed sill/drip edge

> Putting a big window *inside* the hot sauna is a heat-loss tax you’ll pay forever. Vestibule window = same vibe, less pain.

---

## 7) Materials — Hinoki wood (with correct sauna assembly)

### Interior finishes (saunas)
- **Wall/ceiling cladding:** hinoki T&G, 12–15 mm
- **Benches/backrests:** hinoki or abachi (abachi stays cooler to touch)
- **Fasteners:** stainless, hidden where possible
- **No varnish** inside sauna zones

### Wall “sandwich” (sauna rooms)
From inside to outside:
1. Hinoki cladding  
2. Ventilation battens / furring (air gap)  
3. **Aluminum foil vapor barrier** (taped seams, sauna-rated)  
4. Mineral wool insulation  
5. Structural wall  

---

## 8) Floors + drainage (since plumbing exists)

### Vestibule
- Waterproof membrane + tile/microcement
- **Linear drain** (recommended)
- Optional: **cold rinse shower** (premium add-on, small footprint)

### Saunas
- Waterproof base + non-slip tile
- **Removable hinoki duckboards** on top for comfort and maintenance

---

## 9) Ventilation (mandatory)
Each sauna needs its own airflow path.
- **Electric sauna:** supply low near heater, exhaust high opposite wall
- **IR sauna:** supply low, exhaust high opposite wall
- Vent paths must be heat-rated and not dump moist air into hidden cavities.

Vestibule:
- gentle exhaust to prevent humidity buildup near the pool-facing window.

---

## 10) Electrical + controls

### Electrical
- Dedicated circuit for:
  - Electric heater (8–10 kW class)
  - Infrared system (2–3.5 kW typical)
- Place drivers/controllers **outside hot zones** (vestibule or service void)

### Controls (UX)
- Controls mounted in vestibule:
  - temperature setpoint
  - timer + max runtime
  - safety overheat cutoff
  - interior temp sensor (electric sauna)

---

## 11) Lighting
- **Saunas:** indirect LED (behind backrest/under bench), sauna-rated components
- **Vestibule:** warm ambient lighting + optional accent strip to frame the pool view

---

## 12) Deliverables (what you hand to contractor)
1. Dimensioned floor plan (partitions, benches, door swings, window)
2. Interior elevations (bench heights, heater/IR panel layout)
3. Section drawings (dropped sauna ceiling, insulation/vapor barrier)
4. MEP plan (electrical circuits, ventilation routes, drains)
5. Finish schedule (hinoki grade, tile spec, glass/door hardware)

---

## 13) Acceptance criteria (so it’s not vibes-only)
- Electric sauna achieves **~85°C** reliably (with chosen heater + insulation)
- IR sauna reaches **~55°C** with even panel coverage
- No persistent condensation damage around window after regular use
- Doors open smoothly under heat/humidity
- Ventilation prevents “stuffy” feeling at peak occupancy

---

### Premium add-on (high ROI)
Add **a cold rinse shower or bucket shower** in the vestibule + a **towel shelf / robe hooks** + a bench facing the window.
