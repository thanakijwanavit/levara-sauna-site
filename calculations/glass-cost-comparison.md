# Double Glazed Glass Cost Comparison — Thailand

**Project:** Pool-View Dual Sauna Suite  
**Glass Area:** 2 × 5 sqm = **10 sqm total**  
**Application:** Floor-level pool-view windows (as shown in Figma design)

## Cost Comparison: Argon Fill vs. Air Fill

| Specification | Air-Filled IGU | Argon-Filled IGU |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Configuration** | 6mm + 12mm air + 6mm | 6mm + 12mm argon + 6mm |
| **Price per sqm** | ฿2,200 – ฿3,500 | ฿2,800 – ฿5,250 |
| **10 sqm total** | ฿22,000 – ฿35,000 | ฿28,000 – ฿52,500 |
| **U-value** | ~2.8 W/m²K | ~2.5 W/m²K |
| **Thermal improvement** | Baseline | ~10-15% better |

### Price Difference

| Scenario | Air-Filled | Argon-Filled | Difference |
|----------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Low estimate | ฿22,000 | ฿28,000 | +฿6,000 |
| Mid estimate | ฿28,500 | ฿40,250 | +฿11,750 |
| High estimate | ฿35,000 | ฿52,500 | +฿17,500 |

## Recommendation

### For Sauna Suite Application: **Air-filled is sufficient**

**Rationale:**
1. **Location:** Glass is in the vestibule/cool-down area (not inside hot saunas)
2. **Temperature differential:** Vestibule is near ambient temp — argon's insulation benefit is minimal
3. **Thailand climate:** Tropical environment means less heating/cooling demand
4. **Cost savings:** ฿6,000–17,500 saved for negligible performance difference in this application

### When Argon IS worth it:
- Cold climates (heating cost savings)
- Glass directly adjacent to sauna hot zones
- Large window walls with significant thermal bridging

## Additional Considerations for Floor Glass

Your design shows **floor-level glazing** — additional requirements:

| Requirement | Specification | Est. Cost Impact |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Laminated glass** | Required for floor application (safety) | +20-30% |
| **Walk-on rating** | Min 10mm laminated or 12mm tempered | +15-25% |
| **Anti-slip treatment** | Recommended if walking surface | +5-10% |
| **Load rating** | 2.5 kN/m² minimum for residential | Included |

### Revised Estimate for Floor Glass (10 sqm)

| Glass Type | Standard IGU | Floor-rated IGU |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Air-filled | ฿28,000–35,000 | ฿40,000–50,000 |
| Argon-filled | ฿35,000–52,500 | ฿50,000–70,000 |

## Summary Decision Matrix

| Priority | Choose Air-Fill | Choose Argon-Fill |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Budget-conscious | ✓ | |
| Maximum insulation | | ✓ |
| Vestibule/non-heated area | ✓ | |
| Adjacent to hot sauna | | ✓ |
| Thailand tropical climate | ✓ | |
| Cold climate export | | ✓ |

**Recommended for this project:** **Air-filled double glazed, floor-rated laminated**  
**Estimated budget:** ฿40,000–50,000 for 10 sqm

## Supplier Notes

Contact local IGU manufacturers for precise quotes:
- Provide exact dimensions (2 panels × 5 sqm each)
- Specify floor/walk-on application
- Request both air and argon quotes for final comparison
- Confirm lead time (typically 2-4 weeks for custom sizes)
