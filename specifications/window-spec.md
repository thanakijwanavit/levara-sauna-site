# Pool-View Glazing Specification

## Design Update (v2)

Based on Figma floor plan design, the pool view is achieved through **floor-level glazing** rather than wall-mounted windows.

---

## Option A: Floor-Level Glazing (Current Design)

### Location
- **Position:** Floor level, within sauna rooms
- **Quantity:** 2 panels
- **Size:** ~5 sqm each (10 sqm total)
- **Frame:** Orange/copper accent frame (per Figma design)

### Glass Specification

| Property | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Type** | Laminated insulated glass unit (IGU) |
| **Configuration** | 10mm laminated + 12mm air gap + 10mm laminated |
| **Fill gas** | Air (recommended) or Argon (optional upgrade) |
| **U-value** | ~2.5–2.8 W/m²K |
| **Load rating** | 2.5 kN/m² minimum (walk-on rated) |
| **Safety** | Laminated both panes (required for floor application) |

### Cost Estimate (Thailand)

| Fill Type | Price per sqm | 10 sqm Total |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Air-filled (floor-rated) | ฿4,000–5,000 | ฿40,000–50,000 |
| Argon-filled (floor-rated) | ฿5,000–7,000 | ฿50,000–70,000 |

**Recommendation:** Air-filled is sufficient for this application. See `04-calculations/glass-cost-comparison.md` for detailed analysis.

### Frame Requirements
- **Material:** Powder-coated aluminum or stainless steel
- **Color:** Orange/copper accent (per design)
- **Profile:** Flush with floor surface
- **Drainage:** Weep holes to prevent water accumulation

### Structural Requirements
- Floor opening must be structurally reinforced
- Glass supported on all four edges
- Gaskets rated for sauna humidity
- Anti-slip treatment on walking surface

## Option B: Wall-Mounted Window (Original Concept)

### Location (if reverting to original design)
- Vestibule, facing pool — spanning long wall (4.62m)

### Glass Specification

| Property | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Type** | Insulated tempered glass |
| **Configuration** | 6mm tempered + 12mm gap + 6mm tempered |
| **Fill gas** | Air or Argon |
| **U-value** | Maximum 2.8 W/m²K |
| **Safety** | Tempered both panes |

### Frame
- Thermally broken aluminum
- Treated exterior-grade wood
- Wood-clad aluminum (exterior aluminum, interior wood)

---

## Condensation Control (Both Options)

- Low-E coating on interior pane (optional for tropical climate)
- Warm-edge spacer bars
- Adequate ventilation in adjacent spaces
- Properly detailed drainage/weep system

## Notes

> **Design Decision:** The floor-level glazing creates a more dramatic pool connection but requires upgraded glass specification (laminated, walk-on rated) and costs approximately 40-50% more than wall-mounted windows.

> **Thermal Consideration:** Floor glass in sauna rooms will experience temperature differential. Ensure edge seals are rated for 60°C+ ambient temperature in IR sauna zone.
