# Wall Assembly Specification — Sauna Rooms

## Layer Sequence (Inside → Outside)

| Layer | Material | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| 1. Interior Finish | Hinoki T&G cladding, 12–15mm | No finish coating |
| 2. Air Gap | Ventilation battens/furring | Minimum 20mm |
| 3. Vapor Barrier | Aluminum foil | Sauna-rated, taped seams |
| 4. Insulation | Mineral wool | Minimum 100mm, R-3.5 or better |
| 5. Structure | Existing wall | Per building structure |

## Critical Requirements

### Vapor Barrier
- Use **sauna-rated aluminum foil** (not polyethylene)
- Tape all seams with aluminum tape
- Seal around all penetrations (vents, electrical, etc.)
- Overlap minimum 100mm at joints

### Insulation
- Mineral wool preferred (non-combustible)
- No faced insulation (vapor barrier applied separately)
- Fill cavities completely, no compression

### Air Gap
- Maintain continuous air gap behind cladding
- Allows moisture to evaporate between uses
- Vertical furring strips preferred for drainage

## Partition Walls (Sauna-to-Sauna)

Same assembly on both sides of shared partition to maintain thermal separation between different temperature zones.
